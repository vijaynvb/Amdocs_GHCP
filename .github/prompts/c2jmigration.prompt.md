COBOL to Java migration challenges:
Large, complex, monolithic codebases
Poor or missing documentation of business logic
Data structure and storage differences (flat files vs. objects/DB)
Integration with legacy/mainframe systems
Performance tuning for new architecture
Ensuring functional equivalence and thorough testing
Skill gaps in COBOL/Java
Limited effectiveness of automated tools; manual intervention needed
Change management and risk of business disruption
Regulatory and compliance requirements
