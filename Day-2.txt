Hands On:

1. Self exploer COBOl Application [New Developer]
    1. Copilot to explain application [Context]
        1. Add Context 
        2. @commands
    2. generate images [Architecture, Experted Output, Flow Diagram, UML, Sequence, ER] with use of extenstion
        Extensation 
    3. Multi turn prompting 
    4. Run application on docker image
        1. Multi turn prompting to fix issues - using chat history
    5. Write test cases
    6. Write documentation [Depends on project readme.md, swagger, javadoc]
    7. generate a prompt to migrate the application to java

1. Migrate COBOL to Java [Migration Developer]
        1. Use maven as a build tool
        2. clean code practicies [Sonar, Checkstyle, PMD, Findbugs]
    
    1. Prompt Files
    2. Custom Instructions[CI]
    
    3. Sharing common migration process to the team 
    4. Fix Issues [Debugging identify common failuers and make it a rule in CI]
    5. Migration documents

Prompt generation: 
    1. Model 
    2. Prompt + CI

    1. Confluence
    2. Training of model with Confluence -> GPT-4o+Confluence 

Banking domain -> Copilot -> power bi
    1. conflunce
    2. knowledgebase
